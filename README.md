# npm-package-hello-example

This is an example of how to create an **executable** NPM package which can be installed globally on a user's machine.  This means that after a user installs it, they can call the program on their command-line from **any location** on the their filesystem like this:

```
> hello-world
Hello! Have a great day!
```
Or you can call it with an argument:
```
> hello-world Jason
Hello Jason!  Have a great day!
```

You can use this repository as a starting point to create your own executable packages.  I'll also write about how this all works below.

*Note to Windows users:  So far I have only tested this on my Mac. I'm open to feedback to what your experience is like using this on a Windows machine.*

## Installation
To install and run this package globally on your machine, you must have **node** and **npm** installed on your machine. 

*Side note: I have not yet put this package in the main NPM registry, so at the moment these instructions assume you just clone or download this repo directly.*

Download or clone this repository to your machine.  Then, on the command-line, navigate into the root folder of this package.  Then you can install it globally like this:

```
> npm install . -g
```
The `.` in this command just means the current location.

## How to create your own package from scratch

### Overview
The main structure of the package is as follows:
1. A `package.json` which has a `bin` property which specifies that this package will be an executable program
2. A `lib/index.js` file which provides the **main implementation** of the program
3. A `bin/hello-world.bin.js` file which provides the **interface** to users of the program. It gets called when the user runs the program. It parses the command-line arguments and calls a function from the main implementation file (`lib/index.js`) to do the main work.

### Create a `package.json`
First create a `package.json` file for npm. This is how we can tell npm that our package will be an executable.  It will also automatically install them to a userâ€™s PATH (which enables them to call the program from anywhere on their file system).

You can create your `package.json` file either manually or by running `npm init` and answering the questions that it asks.

The you'll need to add a `bin` entry at the end of it like this:
```
{
  ...,
  "bin": {
    "hello-world": "./bin/hello-world.bin.js"
  }
}
```
The `hello-world` will be the name of the executable program that will be installed on users' machines.  The `./bin/hello-world.bin.js` refers to the interface file for the program.  We'll create that next.

### Create the interface file
Since we specified `./bin/hello-world.bin.js` as our interface file, we need to create a `bin` directory in the root of our package, and create the `hello-world.bin.js` file.

One of the keys to this file is the first line where we specify: `#!/usr/bin/env node`.  This is part of what allows npm to generate an executable for this package.

The rest of the file is concerned with two main issues:
1. Parsing the command-line arguments
2. Importing and using the main implementation file to do the work

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// The first line above says to use NODE to run this module

// Import the actual module implementation
const helloApp = require('../lib/index');

// Prepare an argument for our library function
let name = '';
/* Get the "name" from the command-line args, if it was passed.
   Note about arguments: 
    * Arg #1 is "node" (even though the user won't
        have to type that if this module is installed)
    * Arg #2 is the name of this module.
    * So the first real "user arg" is arg #3
*/
if (process.argv.length > 2) {
    name = process.argv[2];
}

// Call our library function.
helloApp.hello(name);

if (process.argv.length < 3) {
    console.log ('\nPro-tip: Try passing in an argument next time. ðŸ˜€');
}
```

### Create the main implementation file
The last main step is the implement the main work file.  In this case its just a simple hello-world script, but it could obviously be much more complicated.

Create an `index.js` file in a `lib` folder in the root of your package.
```javascript
/* This is the primary implementation of the module
   (except for command-line argument parsing - 
    see the script in bin for that)
*/
const hello = (name) => {
    return console.log(`Hello ${name}!  Have a great day!`);
};
exports.hello = hello;
```

### Optional: Add a `preferGlobal` property to `package.json`
You can add the `preferGlobal` flag to `package.json` if you want npm to issue a warning to the user if they try to install the package locally.  It will not prevent them from doing so, but can be a nice guidance to them.

```
{
  ...,
  "preferGlobal": true
}
```

#### Other writeups
I read through [this](http://markmarkoh.com/nodejs-npm-and-executables/) and [this](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/393/how-to-create-a-global-module-for-node-js-properly) and extracted things from both to figure out how to do this. 

#### More robust command-line argument parsing
To parse more complex command-line arguments, I think [this library](https://github.com/75lb/command-line-args/) may be worth a look.
